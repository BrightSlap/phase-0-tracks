		<h2>What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?</h2>
			<p>The purpose of the semantic tags is to display the contents of the body of the page in the format that is desired by the developer and allow for fluidity. I see nav, aside, article, and sections as most useful.
			</p>
		<h2>What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?</h2>
			<p>The order the elements are displayed through the browser is top to bottom.</p>

		<h2>What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?</h2>
			<p>I can create snippets. Oh the joy, I can be so much more <s>lazier</s> efficient now.
		<h2>What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?</h2>
			<p>The creation of snippets what took up most of our time, so I would consider that the one I had most difficulty with. Hopefully through more thorough research, and field testing it should help me understand it more.</p>
