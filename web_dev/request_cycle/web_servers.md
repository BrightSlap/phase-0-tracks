key design philosophies of Linux OS
 - open source (source code is freely available for anyone to download, modiy and redistribute)
 - "Unix was not designed to stop its users from doing stupid things, as that would also stop them from doing clever things." - Doug Gwyn.
 - Allows user complete control, assuming that the user knows what is going to happen while typing in commands.

Virtual Private Server
 - an emulator used as a server that runs its own operating system.
 - Advantages 
 	- Not as big as actual dedicated servers, cost is much lower
 	- Segregated, no direct effect from a server's activity and customization to another server.
 	- Since it has an allocated amount of resources (CPU usage, memory and RAM), it's best to be used for small or medium sized websites.
 As a root user, all admin powers are granted. if programs are run, irreversible changes can be made to the system.
