# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
>Version control is management of the master file and it's multiple variations or edits, branches. This is useful because it allows the user to see the branches made by different users and merges of those files onto the master file by said users. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
>A branch is a copy of the master file, and it is used to make any edits to this copy so that no changes are carried over to master file. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
>A commit is an on-demand Save Point. When making a good commit message, it should be detailed on what was updated since the last commit.

* What is a merge conflict?
>A merge conflict is when the current branch and a merging branch onto the current branch are no longer the same. They have diverged. To fix such conflict, the user must go back in the merging branch to find out what was done to cause it to be different than from the current branch. Media examples would _Steins;Gate_ or _Rick and Morty_'s "A Rickle in Time."
